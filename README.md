Abstract
Many plant diseases have distinct visual symptoms which can be used to identify and classify them correctly. This paper presents a potato disease classification algorithm which leverages these distinct appearances and the recent advances in computer vision made possible by deep learning. The algorithm uses a deep convolutional neural network training it to classify the tubers into five classes, four diseases classes and a healthy potato class. The database of images used in this study, containing potatoes of different shapes, sizes and diseases, was acquired, classified, and labelled manually by experts. The models were trained over different train-test splits to better understand the amount of image data needed to apply deep learning for such classification tasks.
